# Over Index of Knowledge

-> indexer utility
   - should show you and ask for approval on every auto index
-> opportunity to save text or image for each section
-> manual index entry
-> book shortcuts
-> master source page for all indexes and books read
-> opportunity to transcribe image/text markup/comments on an index location 
-> 1-5 star system on the material being indexed

-> work with the plain english dictionary: https://www.mso.anu.edu.au/~ralph/OPTED/

## Individual Indexer
 - Suggested words for index (raw search excluding articles) 
 - 2D index as a grid between the words
    - can be as large as necessary over multiple pages
      just need to split by pages for each section of the grid. 
    - 1D index can be a first special column
    - words should be considered "together" for the purposes of 
      the 2D array if they are within "X" word of each other 
      and DO NOT cross a chapter boundary
